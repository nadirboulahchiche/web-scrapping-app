# web-scrapping-app
a simple web scrapping app usage is simple
just run the main.py file (must be with the ui_main.py ) and you should get a user interface, it's simple to use :

1. Load directory you want to download your images in from the 'Load directory' button.

2. Add all the links you want to download your images from using the 'add link' button.

3. click 'download images' button to download all the data you need.

4. it should print for you in the command wether there was an error or not , if not it should print how many images have been downloaded.

5. click 'clear' button to clear out all inputs.

6. 'quit' to leave the app.

of course it is not perfect it uses a very simple web scrapping methode using beautifull soup but it can be improved in the future.
